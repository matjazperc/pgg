Source code that implements the parallelisation of the Monte Carlo simulation method described in "High-performance parallel computing in the classroom using the public goods game as an example", Eur. J. Phys. 38, 045801 (2017) (http://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6404/aa6a0e). The source code is written in C and thus requires a compiler for this programming language, plus the CUDA programming environment. Executing the code requires a graphics card that supports CUDA.
